## Writeup

- We downloaded the animated GIF image that we split into 6 frames (http://picasion.com/split-animated-gif/). We go to the reading of QR codes (https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) where we get
3L_4SCII_t3_4C3rC4rA_a_L4_Fl4G_071_048_048_071_076_051_102_071_119_065_049
- We decode the ASCII:
G00GL3fGwA1> URL shortener> https://goo.gl/3fGwA1
- We download the following artifact in a file called PuNc3D_C4rD_H4F_R3T0_15.png (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card).
- With the help of the tool "Punched Card Reader generated by kloth.net" we obtain the flag.
